Co-owners share in profits, can vote in Trustee elections, and have defined rights and responsibilities under this Constitution.</p> <p>Co-owner Bonus -- A tax-efficient payment (up to \u00a33,600 per year under UK HMRC rules) made quarterly to eligible co-owners, distinct from profit share.</p> <p>Company Board -- The statutory board of directors of Torchbox Ltd. It has ultimate legal responsibility for the company's compliance with laws and regulations, and for certain high-level decisions.</p> <p>Company Director -- A person formally appointed to the Company Board. Company Directors have legal duties under the UK Companies Act, including promoting the success of the company, exercising reasonable care and skill, and ensuring compliance with legal obligations.</p> <p>Consultation (with employees) -- A process where co-owners are informed about a proposed decision, given an opportunity to share views or feedback, and have those views considered before the decision is finalised. Consultation does not mean co-owners have a vote on the decision.</p> <p>Deed of Trust (Trust Deed) -- The legal document that establishes and governs the Employee Ownership Trust.

International Associates are not employees of Torchbox so they aren't co-owners. However, International Associates can receive profit share, are eligible to vote in Trustee elections, and are included in internal communications and activities. Access to benefits varies due to legal, tax, or logistical constraints.</p> <p>Majority (Simple) -- More than half of the votes cast by those eligible to vote in the decision-making body.</p> <p>Majority (Supermajority) -- A higher voting threshold, often two-thirds or three-quarters of those eligible to vote.</p> <p>NED (Non-Executive Director) -- A member of the Company Board who is not part of the company's executive management team.

When a company is owned and run by the people who work for it, it can serve not just the pursuit of profit, but also people, purpose, and long-term impact.</p> <p>Torchbox isn't privately owned by shareholders or publicly listed; it is owned by the people who work here, through an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) that holds 100% of the company's shares on behalf of all co-owners. We don't just do the work, we also have a voice in how the business is run, how rewards are shared, and how the future is shaped.</p> <p>Co-owners get to benefit from profit sharing, representation, and influence without holding shares in their own name.</p> <p>International Associates, who work with us long-term in countries where we don't have a legal entity, are, as much as possible, treated like co-owners - they participate in profit sharing, voting in Trustee Director elections, and are part of our internal communications and events.</p> <p>Profit still matters, but not at any cost. We aim for sufficient profit: enough to sustain the business, invest in its future, and reward the co-owners who help create it.</p> <p>This Constitution turns our ownership model into something practical and accountable. It reflects the particular values that have shaped our approach to employee ownership. It may not look the same as the model used by other EO businesses.</p> <p>The Constitution is built to last, focusing on principles rather than policies. Day-to-day details can be found on the intranet. It is a reference for understanding how things work, resolving questions, or addressing concerns. It can be used to hold ourselves, fellow co-owners, and leadership to account. It won't answer everything, but it will provide guidance. It is a reference, not a page-turner; something to return to whenever we need it, and it helps us to stay aligned with the principles on which the business was built.</p> <p>Employee ownership is a learning journey, so this Constitution is a work in progress.
